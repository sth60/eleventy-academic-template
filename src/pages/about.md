# Bio

 I am an environmental and labor historian, with an interest in the linkages between factory farming, extractive capitalism, and the Environmental Justice Movement. My dissertation, "'The Winds of Money': Race, Work, and Water in the Texas Panhandle, 1910-1980" explores the construction of new private-oriented modes of water governance and their impact on systems of agricultural production. In this research, I argue that this system of water development has provided fertile ground for far-right conservatism that has opposed movements for justice and sustained Jim Crow policies of segregation and labor appropriation into the late twentieth century.


Outside of my dissertation research, I have contributed to multiple public humanities projects. I am currently serving as project manager for _Voices from the System of Essex County_, an oral history project organized in collaboration with CASA of Essex County. This grassroots project seeks to foreground the perspective of those who have navigated the foster care system to deepen public understanding of the connections between this system and structures of urban inequality.
