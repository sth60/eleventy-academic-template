## [Climates of Inequality](https://climatesofinequality.org/)

_Climates of Inequality_ is a participatory public memory project that connects students, educators, and community leaders from 22 cities to activate the histories of frontline communities. With this project, I curated a display, titled ["Why History Matters"](https://climatesofinequality.org/history/) synthesizing the overlapping histories of colonialism, enslavement, and enviornmental racism that grounds the exhibit.
